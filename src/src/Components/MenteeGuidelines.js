Don’t take it for granted and show your appreciation by thanking them. Give them specific feedback about how they’ve helped you; it not only encourages them, but it also helps them become better mentors.'

After the first few interactions you’ll begin to get a feel for what works for you and your mentor, but, if in doubt, you can be direct about the best times/days to communicate.'
